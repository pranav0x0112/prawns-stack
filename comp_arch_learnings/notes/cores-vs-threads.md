# Cores vs Threads

Understanding the difference between cores and threads is essential to grasp how modern CPUs achieve parallelism and performance.

## What is a Core?

A **core** is a physical processing unit within a CPU. It can independently fetch, decode, execute, and retire instructions. Essentially, it's a fully functional processor.

### Characteristics:

- Has its own ALU, registers, and execution units
    
- Can run one instruction stream (thread) by default
    
- Multiple cores = true hardware-level parallelism

## What is a Thread?

A **thread** is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that the CPU can manage independently. It represents a single stream of execution.

### Hardware Thread (Simultaneous Multithreading / SMT):

Some modern CPU cores implement SMT, allowing a **single core** to run **multiple threads** concurrently by sharing execution resources.

- Common: 2 threads per core (e.g., Intel Hyper-Threading, AMD SMT)
    
- Each thread has its own architectural state (registers, PC, etc.)
    
- Shares caches, functional units, and ROB with its sibling thread

## Multicore CPUs

A **multicore CPU** contains multiple independent cores on the same chip. Each core can usually handle 1–2 threads.

### Example: AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX

- 8 physical cores
    
- Supports SMT: 2 threads per core
    
- Total: 16 threads
    

This means:

- 8 instruction pipelines can execute in parallel
    
- Up to 16 threads can be scheduled by the OS

## Analogy

- **Core**: Like a chef in a kitchen
    
- **Thread**: A task the chef is doing (e.g., chopping, boiling)
    
- More chefs (cores) → more dishes at once
    
- Each chef doing two tasks at once (threads) → higher efficiency (if resources are available)

## Summary

|Term|Description|
|---|---|
|Core|Physical execution engine|
|Thread|Logical instruction stream|
|SMT|Allows a core to run multiple threads|
|Multicore|Multiple cores on one CPU chip|

Modern CPUs use both multicore and SMT to maximize parallelism and throughput.
